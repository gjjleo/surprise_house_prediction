## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
- We used ridge and lasso regression to solve the problems:
	Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
	How well do those variables describe the price of a house.
- We have collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.
